# CDSS-XAI-HCE-Survey

Please refer to the file queries.txt.

We started with a general selection of keywords covering the healthcare, XAI, and HCE main fields as in Query 1.
We then expanded the query by adding several granular terms for each main field as follows as in Query 2.
We then refined the search to the following query to accomodate Web of Science restriction of 100 keywords per search by deleting some redundant or too granular terms, forming Query 3.
